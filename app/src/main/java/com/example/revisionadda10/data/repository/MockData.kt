                    "Euclid's Division Lemma - Detailed Explanation: This fundamental lemma states that for any two positive integers a (dividend) and b (divisor), there exist unique integers q (quotient) and r (remainder) such that a = bq + r, where 0 ≤ r < b. The remainder r must always be less than the divisor b. This lemma is the foundation of the division algorithm and is crucial for finding HCF. Example: For a = 17 and b = 5, we get 17 = 5 × 3 + 2, so q = 3 and r = 2. The uniqueness means there's only one way to express this relationship. This lemma works because when we divide any number, we always get a quotient and remainder, and the remainder is always smaller than the divisor. This property is used repeatedly in the division algorithm to find HCF.",
                    
                    "Euclid's Division Algorithm - Step-by-Step Process: This is a systematic method to find the Highest Common Factor (HCF) of two numbers. The algorithm works as follows: Step 1 - Apply division lemma: Divide the larger number by the smaller number to get quotient and remainder. Step 2 - Check remainder: If remainder is 0, then the divisor is the HCF. Step 3 - Continue if needed: If remainder is not 0, apply the lemma again using the previous divisor as new dividend and remainder as new divisor. Repeat until remainder becomes 0. The last non-zero remainder is the HCF. Example: Find HCF of 48 and 18. First division: 48 = 18 × 2 + 12 (remainder 12). Second division: 18 = 12 × 1 + 6 (remainder 6). Third division: 12 = 6 × 2 + 0 (remainder 0). Since remainder is 0, HCF = 6. This algorithm is efficient and works for any two positive integers. It's based on the principle that HCF(a, b) = HCF(b, r) where r is the remainder when a is divided by b.",
                    
                    "Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic - Complete Understanding: This theorem states that every composite number (number greater than 1 that is not prime) can be expressed as a product of prime numbers, and this factorization is unique, except for the order in which the prime factors are written. This means every number has one and only one prime factorization. Example: 12 can be written as 2² × 3 or 3 × 2², but these are considered the same factorization. The theorem has two parts: Existence (every composite number has a prime factorization) and Uniqueness (this factorization is unique). This theorem is fundamental because it allows us to find HCF and LCM easily. To find HCF: Take common prime factors with lowest power. To find LCM: Take all prime factors with highest power. Example: For 12 = 2² × 3 and 18 = 2 × 3², HCF = 2 × 3 = 6 (common factors with lowest power), LCM = 2² × 3² = 36 (all factors with highest power). This theorem is the basis for many number theory concepts.",
                    
                    "HCF (Highest Common Factor) - Comprehensive Guide: HCF is the largest positive integer that divides two or more numbers exactly without leaving any remainder. It's also called Greatest Common Divisor (GCD). Methods to find HCF: Method 1 - Prime Factorization: Express each number as product of primes, then take common factors with lowest power. Example: For 24 = 2³ × 3 and 36 = 2² × 3², common factors are 2² and 3¹, so HCF = 2² × 3 = 12. Method 2 - Division Algorithm: Use Euclid's division algorithm which is more efficient for large numbers. Method 3 - Listing Factors: List all factors and find the highest common one (works for small numbers). Properties: HCF of two numbers divides their LCM. HCF × LCM = Product of two numbers (only for two numbers). If HCF of two numbers is 1, they are called co-prime. HCF is always positive. Applications: Used in simplifying fractions, solving word problems involving division, and in various mathematical calculations.",
                    
                    "LCM (Least Common Multiple) - Detailed Explanation: LCM is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of two or more numbers. It's the smallest number that all given numbers divide exactly. Methods to find LCM: Method 1 - Prime Factorization: Express each number as product of primes, then take all factors with highest power. Example: For 12 = 2² × 3 and 18 = 2 × 3², LCM = 2² × 3² = 36. Method 2 - Division Method: Write numbers, divide by common prime factors, continue until all numbers become 1, multiply all divisors. Method 3 - Listing Multiples: List multiples and find the smallest common one (works for small numbers). Important Formula: For two numbers a and b, HCF(a, b) × LCM(a, b) = a × b. This formula is very useful: if we know HCF, we can find LCM and vice versa. Example: If HCF of 12 and 18 is 6, then LCM = (12 × 18) / 6 = 216 / 6 = 36. Properties: LCM is always greater than or equal to the largest number. LCM of co-prime numbers is their product. Applications: Used in adding/subtracting fractions with different denominators, solving problems involving time intervals, and in various real-life scenarios.",
                    
                    "Rational Numbers - Complete Concept: Rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed in the form p/q where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0. The word 'rational' comes from 'ratio'. All integers are rational numbers (can be written as n/1). Examples: 1/2, -3/4, 5 (as 5/1), 0 (as 0/1), 22/7, -15/3. Properties: Every rational number has either a terminating decimal expansion (like 1/2 = 0.5) or a non-terminating repeating decimal expansion (like 1/3 = 0.333...). The decimal expansion terminates if the denominator (in lowest terms) has only 2 and/or 5 as prime factors. If denominator has other prime factors, the decimal is non-terminating but repeating. Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (except by zero) of rational numbers always give rational numbers. Between any two rational numbers, there are infinitely many rational numbers. This property is called density of rational numbers. Representation: Rational numbers can be represented on a number line. Every rational number has a unique position on the number line.",
                    
                    "Irrational Numbers - Detailed Understanding: Irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be expressed in the form p/q where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0. They have non-terminating, non-repeating decimal expansions. Examples: √2, √3, √5, √7 (square roots of non-perfect squares), π (pi ≈ 3.14159...), e (Euler's number ≈ 2.71828...), and many others. Key Properties: Their decimal expansion never terminates and never repeats. They cannot be represented as fractions. They are real numbers (can be represented on number line). Sum, difference, product, and quotient of a rational and irrational number is irrational (except when multiplying/dividing by 0). Sum or product of two irrationals may be rational or irrational. Examples: √2 + √2 = 2√2 (irrational), but √2 + (-√2) = 0 (rational). Proving Irrationality: To prove √p is irrational (p is prime), we use proof by contradiction: Assume √p = a/b (in lowest terms), then p = a²/b², so pb² = a². This means a² is divisible by p, so a is divisible by p. Let a = pk, then pb² = p²k², so b² = pk², meaning b is also divisible by p. This contradicts that a/b was in lowest terms. Hence √p is irrational.",
                    
                    "Decimal Expansions - Comprehensive Explanation: Every real number has a decimal expansion. For rational numbers: Type 1 - Terminating Decimals: These decimals end after a finite number of digits. Example: 1/2 = 0.5, 3/4 = 0.75, 1/8 = 0.125. A rational number p/q (in lowest terms) has terminating decimal if and only if q has no prime factors other than 2 and 5. Type 2 - Non-terminating Repeating Decimals: These decimals don't end but have a repeating pattern. Example: 1/3 = 0.333..., 1/7 = 0.142857142857..., 22/7 = 3.142857142857... The repeating part is called the period. For irrational numbers: Non-terminating, Non-repeating Decimals: These decimals never end and never repeat. Example: √2 = 1.414213562..., π = 3.141592653..., e = 2.718281828... There's no pattern in these decimals. Converting Decimals to Fractions: Terminating: 0.5 = 5/10 = 1/2. Repeating: 0.333... = 1/3 (let x = 0.333..., then 10x = 3.333..., subtract: 9x = 3, so x = 1/3). This understanding helps identify whether a number is rational or irrational.",
                    
                    "Proving Irrationality - Step-by-Step Method: To prove that √p is irrational (where p is a prime number), we use proof by contradiction. Step 1 - Assume the opposite: Assume √p is rational, so √p = a/b where a and b are integers, b ≠ 0, and a/b is in lowest terms (HCF of a and b is 1). Step 2 - Square both sides: (√p)² = (a/b)², which gives p = a²/b². Step 3 - Rearrange: pb² = a². This means a² is divisible by p. Step 4 - Use prime property: Since p is prime and divides a², p must divide a (if prime divides square, it divides the number). Step 5 - Express a: Let a = pk for some integer k. Step 6 - Substitute: pb² = (pk)² = p²k², so b² = pk². Step 7 - Contradiction: This means b² is divisible by p, so b is divisible by p. But we assumed a/b was in lowest terms, meaning a and b have no common factor. However, we've shown both a and b are divisible by p, which is a contradiction. Step 8 - Conclusion: Our assumption was wrong, so √p must be irrational. This method works for any prime number. Example: √2, √3, √5, √7 are all irrational.",

                    "Polynomial - Complete Definition and Understanding: A polynomial is an algebraic expression of the form a₀ + a₁x + a₂x² + ... + aₙxⁿ where a₀, a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ are real numbers (called coefficients), aₙ ≠ 0 (leading coefficient), and n is a non-negative integer (degree). The variable x is called the indeterminate. Key points: All powers must be non-negative integers (no negative or fractional powers). Coefficients can be any real numbers. The term with highest power is called the leading term. The coefficient of leading term (aₙ) must be non-zero. Examples: 3x² + 2x - 5 is a polynomial (degree 2), 4x³ - x + 7 is a polynomial (degree 3), but 1/x + 2 is not a polynomial (negative power), √x + 3 is not a polynomial (fractional power). Polynomials are used extensively in algebra, calculus, and various applications in science and engineering.",
                    
                    "Degree of Polynomial - Detailed Explanation: The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial when it is written in standard form (descending powers). It determines many properties of the polynomial. Examples: x³ + 2x² - 5x + 1 has degree 3 (highest power is 3), 4x⁵ - 3x² + 7 has degree 5, 2x + 3 has degree 1, 5 has degree 0 (constant polynomial). The zero polynomial (all coefficients zero) has undefined degree. Importance: Degree tells us maximum number of zeroes (a polynomial of degree n can have at most n zeroes). Degree determines the general shape of the graph. For even degree, both ends go in same direction; for odd degree, ends go in opposite directions. The degree helps classify polynomials: degree 0 = constant, degree 1 = linear, degree 2 = quadratic, degree 3 = cubic, degree 4 = biquadratic or quartic.",
                    
                    "Types of Polynomials - Comprehensive Classification: Polynomials are classified based on their degree: Constant Polynomial (degree 0): Form is a₀ where a₀ ≠ 0. Example: 5, -3, 7. Graph is a horizontal line. Linear Polynomial (degree 1): Form is a₁x + a₀ where a₁ ≠ 0. Example: 2x + 3, -x + 5. Graph is a straight line. Has exactly one zero. Quadratic Polynomial (degree 2): Form is a₂x² + a₁x + a₀ where a₂ ≠ 0. Example: x² - 5x + 6, 2x² + 3x - 1. Graph is a parabola. Can have 0, 1, or 2 real zeroes. Cubic Polynomial (degree 3): Form is a₃x³ + a₂x² + a₁x + a₀ where a₃ ≠ 0. Example: x³ - 2x² + x - 1. Can have 1, 2, or 3 real zeroes. Biquadratic/Quartic (degree 4): Form is a₄x⁴ + ... Example: x⁴ - 5x² + 4. Can have up to 4 real zeroes. Higher degree polynomials follow similar patterns. Also classified by number of terms: Monomial (1 term), Binomial (2 terms), Trinomial (3 terms), Polynomial (4+ terms).",
                    
                    "Zero of Polynomial - Complete Concept: A zero (or root) of a polynomial p(x) is a value of x for which p(x) = 0. In other words, if p(α) = 0, then α is a zero of the polynomial. Key properties: A polynomial of degree n can have at most n zeroes (Fundamental Theorem of Algebra). Zeroes can be real or complex numbers. A zero can be repeated (multiplicity). Example: For p(x) = x² - 5x + 6, we have p(2) = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0 and p(3) = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0, so 2 and 3 are zeroes. Finding zeroes: For linear: Solve ax + b = 0, so x = -b/a. For quadratic: Use factorization, completing square, or quadratic formula x = (-b ± √(b²-4ac))/(2a). For higher degree: Factor theorem, synthetic division, or numerical methods. Relationship: If α is a zero, then (x - α) is a factor. This is the Factor Theorem. Multiple zeroes: If (x - α)ᵏ is a factor, then α is a zero of multiplicity k. Example: For p(x) = (x-2)²(x-3), zeroes are 2 (multiplicity 2) and 3 (multiplicity 1).",
                    
                    "Geometric Meaning of Zeroes - Visual Understanding: The zeroes of a polynomial p(x) have a beautiful geometric interpretation. They are the x-coordinates of the points where the graph of y = p(x) intersects the x-axis. Detailed explanation: When we plot y = p(x) on coordinate plane, the graph crosses or touches the x-axis at points where p(x) = 0. These intersection points have coordinates (α, 0) where α is a zero. For linear polynomial: Graph is a straight line that crosses x-axis at exactly one point (the zero). For quadratic: Graph is a parabola that can cross x-axis at 0, 1 (touching), or 2 points depending on discriminant. For cubic: Graph can cross x-axis at 1, 2, or 3 points. Number of intersections = number of real zeroes. If graph touches x-axis but doesn't cross, that zero has even multiplicity. If graph crosses x-axis, that zero has odd multiplicity. Example: For p(x) = x² - 4, zeroes are x = 2 and x = -2. Graph (parabola) crosses x-axis at (-2, 0) and (2, 0). This geometric interpretation helps visualize and understand polynomial behavior.",
                    
                    "Relationship between Zeroes and Coefficients (Quadratic) - Detailed Formulas: For a quadratic polynomial ax² + bx + c = 0 (where a ≠ 0) with zeroes α and β, there are important relationships: Sum of zeroes: α + β = -b/a. This means sum equals negative of coefficient of x divided by coefficient of x². Product of zeroes: αβ = c/a. This means product equals constant term divided by coefficient of x². Derivation: If α and β are zeroes, then (x - α)(x - β) = 0. Expanding: x² - (α + β)x + αβ = 0. Comparing with ax² + bx + c = 0, we get: -b/a = α + β and c/a = αβ. Applications: If we know zeroes, we can form the polynomial: x² - (sum)x + (product) = 0. Example: If zeroes are 2 and 3, then sum = 5, product = 6, so polynomial is x² - 5x + 6 = 0. We can find expressions like α² + β² = (α + β)² - 2αβ, α/β + β/α = (α² + β²)/(αβ), etc. These relationships are very useful in solving problems.",
                    
                    "Relationship for Cubic Polynomial - Complete Formulas: For a cubic polynomial ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0 (where a ≠ 0) with zeroes α, β, and γ, we have three important relationships: Sum of zeroes: α + β + γ = -b/a. Sum of products taken two at a time: αβ + βγ + γα = c/a. Product of zeroes: αβγ = -d/a. Derivation: If α, β, γ are zeroes, then (x - α)(x - β)(x - γ) = 0. Expanding: x³ - (α + β + γ)x² + (αβ + βγ + γα)x - αβγ = 0. Comparing with ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0, we get the relationships. Applications: If we know zeroes, we can form the polynomial. Example: If zeroes are 1, 2, 3, then sum = 6, sum of products = 11, product = 6, so polynomial is x³ - 6x² + 11x - 6 = 0. We can find various expressions: α² + β² + γ² = (α + β + γ)² - 2(αβ + βγ + γα), α³ + β³ + γ³ = (α + β + γ)³ - 3(α + β + γ)(αβ + βγ + γα) + 3αβγ, etc. These relationships extend to higher degree polynomials as well.",
                    
                    "Division Algorithm for Polynomials - Step-by-Step Process: If p(x) and g(x) are polynomials with g(x) ≠ 0, then we can find unique polynomials q(x) (quotient) and r(x) (remainder) such that p(x) = g(x) × q(x) + r(x), where r(x) = 0 or degree of r(x) < degree of g(x). This is similar to division algorithm for integers. Process: Step 1 - Arrange both polynomials in descending powers. Step 2 - Divide first term of dividend by first term of divisor to get first term of quotient. Step 3 - Multiply divisor by this term and subtract from dividend. Step 4 - Bring down next term and repeat. Step 5 - Continue until degree of remainder is less than degree of divisor. Example: Divide x³ + 2x² - 5x + 1 by x - 1. Result: Quotient = x² + 3x - 2, Remainder = -1. Verification: (x - 1)(x² + 3x - 2) + (-1) = x³ + 3x² - 2x - x² - 3x + 2 - 1 = x³ + 2x² - 5x + 1. Applications: Used to check if (x - a) is a factor, to find remainder without actual division, and in polynomial factorization.",
                    
                    "Remainder Theorem - Complete Understanding: If a polynomial p(x) is divided by (x - a), then the remainder is p(a). This is a powerful theorem that allows us to find remainder without performing actual division. Proof: By division algorithm, p(x) = (x - a)q(x) + r, where r is remainder (a constant since degree of (x-a) is 1). Substituting x = a: p(a) = (a - a)q(a) + r = 0 + r = r. So remainder r = p(a). Applications: To find remainder when p(x) is divided by (x - a), simply substitute x = a in p(x). Example: Find remainder when x³ - 2x² + 3x - 1 is divided by (x - 2). Solution: p(2) = 8 - 8 + 6 - 1 = 5. So remainder is 5. To check if (x - a) is a factor: If p(a) = 0, then remainder is 0, so (x - a) is a factor. This leads to Factor Theorem. The theorem works for any linear divisor (x - a). For divisor (ax - b), remainder is p(b/a). This theorem saves a lot of calculation time.",
                    
                    "Factor Theorem - Detailed Explanation: (x - a) is a factor of polynomial p(x) if and only if p(a) = 0. This is a direct consequence of Remainder Theorem. 'If and only if' means: If (x - a) is a factor, then p(a) = 0. AND if p(a) = 0, then (x - a) is a factor. Proof: If (x - a) is a factor, then p(x) = (x - a)q(x) for some q(x). So p(a) = (a - a)q(a) = 0. Conversely, if p(a) = 0, then by Remainder Theorem, remainder when p(x) is divided by (x - a) is p(a) = 0. So p(x) = (x - a)q(x), meaning (x - a) is a factor. Applications: To check if (x - a) is a factor: Substitute x = a, if p(a) = 0, then it's a factor. To find factors: If we know a zero α, then (x - α) is a factor. To factorize polynomials: Find zeroes, then write as product of (x - zero) factors. Example: For p(x) = x² - 5x + 6, p(2) = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0, so (x - 2) is a factor. Similarly, p(3) = 0, so (x - 3) is a factor. Therefore, p(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3). This theorem is fundamental in polynomial factorization."

                    "Linear Equation in Two Variables - Complete Definition: A linear equation in two variables is an equation of the form ax + by + c = 0 where a, b, c are real numbers and a, b are not both zero (at least one of a or b must be non-zero). The variables x and y are called unknowns. Key properties: The graph of such an equation is always a straight line. The equation is called 'linear' because the highest power of variables is 1. Examples: 2x + 3y - 5 = 0 (linear), x - y + 1 = 0 (linear), but x² + y = 3 is not linear (power 2). Standard form: ax + by + c = 0. General form: ax + by = c. Slope-intercept form: y = mx + b (where m is slope, b is y-intercept). Every point (x, y) on the line satisfies the equation. There are infinitely many solutions to a single linear equation in two variables. Applications: Used to model relationships between two quantities, solve real-world problems, and represent lines in coordinate geometry.",
                    
                    "Solution of Pair of Linear Equations - Detailed Concept: A solution of a pair of linear equations a₁x + b₁y + c₁ = 0 and a₂x + b₂y + c₂ = 0 is an ordered pair (x, y) that satisfies both equations simultaneously. This means when we substitute x and y in both equations, both become true statements. Geometric meaning: The solution represents the coordinates of the point where the graphs of both equations (lines) intersect. If lines intersect at one point, there's a unique solution. If lines are parallel, they never intersect, so no solution. If lines coincide (same line), every point on the line is a solution, so infinitely many solutions. Finding solution: We need to find values of x and y that make both equations true. Methods: Graphical method (plot and find intersection), Substitution method, Elimination method, Cross multiplication method. Example: For equations 2x + y = 5 and x - y = 1, the solution is x = 2, y = 1. Verification: 2(2) + 1 = 5 ✓ and 2 - 1 = 1 ✓. The solution is unique in this case.",
                    
                    "Types of Solutions - Comprehensive Classification: A pair of linear equations can have three types of solutions based on the relationship between coefficients: Type 1 - Unique Solution: The two lines intersect at exactly one point. Condition: a₁/a₂ ≠ b₁/b₂ (ratios of coefficients of x and y are different). This means lines have different slopes. Example: 2x + 3y = 7 and 3x - 2y = 1 have unique solution because 2/3 ≠ 3/(-2). The system is called consistent and independent. Type 2 - Infinitely Many Solutions: The two lines coincide (are the same line). Condition: a₁/a₂ = b₁/b₂ = c₁/c₂ (all three ratios are equal). This means equations are equivalent (one is multiple of other). Example: 2x + 4y = 6 and x + 2y = 3 are same (second is half of first). Every point on the line is a solution. The system is called consistent and dependent. Type 3 - No Solution: The two lines are parallel (never intersect). Condition: a₁/a₂ = b₁/b₂ ≠ c₁/c₂ (ratios of x and y coefficients are equal but constant terms ratio is different). Example: 2x + 3y = 5 and 4x + 6y = 10 have no solution (second is 2×first, but constants don't match). The system is called inconsistent. Understanding these conditions helps quickly determine solution type without solving.",
                    
                    "Graphical Method - Step-by-Step Process: This method involves plotting both equations on the same coordinate plane and finding their point of intersection. Steps: Step 1 - Convert to slope-intercept form: Express each equation as y = mx + c for easier plotting. Step 2 - Find points: For each equation, find at least two points by substituting values of x and finding corresponding y. Step 3 - Plot lines: Plot both lines on the same graph paper. Step 4 - Identify intersection: The point where both lines meet is the solution. Step 5 - Read coordinates: Read the (x, y) coordinates of intersection point. Advantages: Visual representation helps understand the relationship. Can see if lines are parallel or coincident. Disadvantages: May not give exact values if intersection is not at grid points. Less accurate than algebraic methods. Example: For 2x + y = 5 and x - y = 1, plotting gives intersection at (2, 1), which is the solution. Special cases: If lines are parallel, they never meet (no solution). If lines coincide, every point is intersection (infinite solutions). This method is useful for understanding but algebraic methods are more precise.",
                    
                    "Substitution Method - Detailed Procedure: This method involves expressing one variable in terms of the other from one equation, then substituting this expression into the second equation. Steps: Step 1 - Choose an equation: Pick the simpler equation (usually one with coefficient 1). Step 2 - Express one variable: Solve for one variable (say y) in terms of the other (x). Step 3 - Substitute: Replace this expression in the second equation. Step 4 - Solve: Solve the resulting equation in one variable. Step 5 - Find other variable: Substitute the found value back into the expression from Step 2. Step 6 - Verify: Check that both values satisfy both original equations. Example: Solve 2x + y = 5 and x - y = 1. From second: y = x - 1. Substitute in first: 2x + (x - 1) = 5, so 3x = 6, x = 2. Then y = 2 - 1 = 1. Solution: (2, 1). Advantages: Works well when one variable has coefficient 1. Straightforward and systematic. Can be used for any pair of linear equations. This method is particularly useful when equations are not easily manipulated for elimination.",
                    
                    "Elimination Method - Complete Process: This method involves eliminating one variable by adding or subtracting the equations after making coefficients of that variable equal. Steps: Step 1 - Check coefficients: Look at coefficients of one variable (say x) in both equations. Step 2 - Make coefficients equal: Multiply one or both equations by suitable numbers so coefficients of chosen variable become equal (or opposite). Step 3 - Eliminate: Add or subtract equations to eliminate that variable. If coefficients are equal, subtract. If coefficients are opposite, add. Step 4 - Solve: Solve the resulting equation in one variable. Step 5 - Find other variable: Substitute the found value in any original equation. Step 6 - Verify: Check solution in both equations. Example: Solve 2x + 3y = 7 and 3x - 2y = 1. Multiply first by 2: 4x + 6y = 14. Multiply second by 3: 9x - 6y = 3. Add: 13x = 17, so x = 17/13. Substitute: 2(17/13) + 3y = 7, so 3y = 7 - 34/13 = (91-34)/13 = 57/13, y = 19/13. Advantages: Works well when coefficients are easily made equal. Often faster than substitution. Very systematic approach.",
                    
                    "Cross Multiplication Method - Formula and Application: This is a direct formula method for solving two linear equations. For equations a₁x + b₁y + c₁ = 0 and a₂x + b₂y + c₂ = 0, the solution is given by: x/(b₁c₂ - b₂c₁) = y/(c₁a₂ - c₂a₁) = 1/(a₁b₂ - a₂b₁). This gives: x = (b₁c₂ - b₂c₁)/(a₁b₂ - a₂b₁) and y = (c₁a₂ - c₂a₁)/(a₁b₂ - a₂b₁). The denominator (a₁b₂ - a₂b₁) is called the determinant. If determinant = 0, then a₁/a₂ = b₁/b₂, meaning lines are parallel or coincident. Steps: Step 1 - Write in standard form: Ensure both equations are in form ax + by + c = 0. Step 2 - Identify coefficients: Note a₁, b₁, c₁ for first equation and a₂, b₂, c₂ for second. Step 3 - Apply formula: Use cross multiplication formula. Step 4 - Calculate: Find x and y values. Example: For x + y - 3 = 0 and 2x - y - 1 = 0, we have a₁=1, b₁=1, c₁=-3, a₂=2, b₂=-1, c₂=-1. x = (1×(-1) - (-1)×(-3))/(1×(-1) - 2×1) = (-1-3)/(-1-2) = -4/-3 = 4/3. y = ((-3)×2 - (-1)×1)/(1×(-1) - 2×1) = (-6+1)/(-3) = -5/-3 = 5/3. This method is quick when formula is memorized.",

Steps: Step 1 - Read carefully: Understand the problem statement completely. Step 2 - Identify variables: Choose what x and y represent. Use meaningful names if possible. Step 3 - Form equations: Translate statements into mathematical equations. Look for keywords: 'sum', 'difference', 'total', 'more than', 'less than', etc. Step 4 - Solve: Use any method (substitution, elimination, etc.) to solve the system. Step 5 - Interpret: Check if solution makes sense in context. Step 6 - Verify: Ensure answer satisfies all conditions in problem. Example: 'Sum of two numbers is 15, and their difference is 3. Find the numbers.' Let numbers be x and y. Equations: x + y = 15, x - y = 3. Solving: Adding gives 2x = 18, so x = 9. Then y = 15 - 9 = 6. Verification: 9 + 6 = 15 ✓, 9 - 6 = 3 ✓.

                    "Consistent System - Detailed Explanation: A system of linear equations is called consistent if it has at least one solution. This means the equations are compatible and can be solved. Types of consistent systems: Consistent and Independent: Has exactly one unique solution. Condition: a₁/a₂ ≠ b₁/b₂. The two lines intersect at one point. Example: 2x + y = 5 and x - y = 1 have unique solution (2, 1). Consistent and Dependent: Has infinitely many solutions. Condition: a₁/a₂ = b₁/b₂ = c₁/c₂. The two lines coincide. Example: 2x + 4y = 6 and x + 2y = 3 are same line, so every point on line is solution. In both cases, the system is consistent because solutions exist. To check consistency: Calculate ratios a₁/a₂, b₁/b₂, c₁/c₂. If a₁/a₂ ≠ b₁/b₂, system is consistent with unique solution. If all three ratios are equal, system is consistent with infinite solutions. Consistent systems always have solutions, making them 'solvable'.",

This means the equations contradict each other and cannot be satisfied simultaneously. Condition: a₁/a₂ = b₁/b₂ ≠ c₁/c₂. This means the ratios of coefficients of x and y are equal, but the ratio of constant terms is different. Geometric meaning: The two lines are parallel (have same slope but different y-intercepts). Since parallel lines never intersect, there's no point that satisfies both equations. Example: 2x + 3y = 5 and 4x + 6y = 10. Here, 2/4 = 3/6 = 1/2, but 5/10 = 1/2. Wait, let me check: Actually, 2/4 = 1/2, 3/6 = 1/2, 5/10 = 1/2, so this is consistent (coincident lines). Correct example: 2x + 3y = 5 and 4x + 6y = 7. Here, 2/4 = 3/6 = 1/2, but 5/7 ≠ 1/2, so no solution. When solving, you'll get a false statement like 0 = 1, indicating no solution. Inconsistent systems represent contradictory conditions that cannot both be true."

Nutrition - Obtaining and utilizing food\n2. Respiration - Releasing energy from food\n3. Transportation - Moving materials within body\n4. Excretion - Removing waste products\n5. Control and Coordination - Responding to environment\n6. Reproduction - Producing offspring\n7. Growth - Increasing in size\n\nAll living organisms perform these processes:\n• Plants: Autotrophic nutrition, simple transport systems\n• Animals: Heterotrophic nutrition, complex organ systems\n• Both need energy, materials, and waste removal\n\nThese processes are interconnected - one cannot function without others. Understanding these processes helps understand how living things survive and function.",

Regular Reflection:\n   • Occurs on smooth, polished surfaces\n   • Parallel rays remain parallel after reflection\n   • Forms clear images\n   • Example: Mirror, still water\n\n2. Diffuse Reflection:\n   • Occurs on rough, uneven surfaces\n   • Parallel rays scatter in different directions\n   • No clear image formed\n   • Example: Paper, wall, most objects\n\nKey Terms:\n• Incident Ray: Light ray striking the surface\n• Reflected Ray: Light ray bouncing back\n• Normal: Perpendicular line to surface at point of incidence\n• Angle of Incidence (i): Angle between incident ray and normal\n• Angle of Reflection (r): Angle between reflected ray and normal\n\nReflection allows us to see non-luminous objects. All objects reflect light, which enters our eyes.",
                    
                    "Laws of Reflection - Fundamental Principles:\n\nThere are two laws of reflection:\n\nLaw 1: Angle of Incidence = Angle of Reflection\n• ∠i = ∠r\n• Both angles measured from normal\n• Always equal, regardless of angle\n• Example: If i = 30°, then r = 30°\n\nLaw 2: Incident Ray, Reflected Ray, and Normal Lie in Same Plane\n• All three are in one plane\n• Normal is perpendicular to surface\n• Plane contains all three lines\n\nVerification:\n• Can be verified using plane mirror and pins\n• Light ray experiment confirms both laws\n• Works for all surfaces (smooth and rough)\n\nApplications:\n• Designing mirrors\n• Understanding image formation\n• Periscopes, kaleidoscopes\n• Optical instruments\n\nThese laws are universal and apply to all types of reflection.",

Virtual Image:\n   • Cannot be obtained on screen\n   • Formed behind mirror\n   • Light rays appear to come from behind\n\n2. Erect Image:\n   • Same orientation as object\n   • Not inverted\n\n3. Same Size:\n   • Image size = Object size\n   • No magnification\n\n4. Same Distance:\n   • Image distance = Object distance\n   • If object is 5m from mirror, image is 5m behind mirror\n\n5.

Types: Binary fission (Amoeba, bacteria - splits into two), Budding (Hydra, yeast - bud grows and detaches), Fragmentation (Planaria, Spirogyra - breaks into pieces, each grows), Spore formation (fungi, ferns - spores germinate), Vegetative propagation (plants - roots, stems, leaves). Advantages: Fast, no mate needed. Disadvantage: No genetic variation.",
                    "Sexual Reproduction: Two parents, fusion of gametes, genetic variation. Male gamete (sperm) + Female gamete (egg) → Zygote → Embryo → Offspring. Advantages: Genetic diversity, evolution, adaptation. Disadvantage: Slower, requires two parents. In plants: Pollination (transfer of pollen) → Fertilization (fusion of gametes) → Seed formation. In animals: Mating → Fertilization → Development → Birth/Hatching.",
                    "Human Reproductive System: Male: Testes (produce sperm, testosterone), Epididymis (sperm storage), Vas deferens, Urethra, Penis. Female: Ovaries (produce eggs, estrogen, progesterone), Fallopian tubes (fertilization site), Uterus (embryo development), Vagina. Fertilization in fallopian tube, embryo implants in uterus. Menstrual cycle: ~28 days, ovulation on day 14, prepares uterus for pregnancy.",
                    "Reproduction in Plants: Flowering plants: Flower contains reproductive parts. Male: Stamen (anther produces pollen, filament). Female: Carpel (stigma receives pollen, style, ovary contains ovules). Pollination: Self (same flower/plant) or Cross (different plant). Fertilization: Pollen tube grows, sperm fuses with egg → zygote → seed. Seed contains embryo, develops into new plant. Asexual: Vegetative propagation (runners, bulbs, tubers).",
                    "Reproductive Health: Maintaining healthy reproductive system. Importance: Healthy offspring, prevention of diseases, family planning. Practices: Hygiene, balanced diet, regular check-ups, safe sex practices, vaccination (HPV), awareness. Issues: STDs, infertility, teenage pregnancy. Education and awareness crucial. Family planning methods: Natural, barrier, hormonal, surgical. Important for individual and societal health."

Eye works like camera, forms inverted image on retina, brain interprets it as upright.",
                    "Accommodation: Ability of eye to focus on objects at different distances by changing lens shape. For nearby objects: Ciliary muscles contract, lens becomes thicker and more curved, focal length decreases. For distant objects: Ciliary muscles relax, lens becomes thinner and less curved, focal length increases. Normal eye can focus from 25cm (near point) to infinity (far point). Accommodation decreases with age (presbyopia). Essential for clear vision at all distances.",

Correction: Concave lens (diverging). Hypermetropia (Far-sightedness): Can see distant clearly, nearby objects blurry. Cause: Eye too short or lens too flat. Correction: Convex lens (converging). Presbyopia: Loss of accommodation with age. Correction: Bifocal lenses. Cataract: Clouding of lens. Treatment: Surgery to replace lens. Astigmatism: Irregular cornea. Correction: Cylindrical lenses.",

Colors in order: VIBGYOR (Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red). Violet bends most (highest frequency, shortest wavelength), Red bends least (lowest frequency, longest wavelength). Rainbow is natural example of dispersion (water droplets act as prisms). Each color has different wavelength and frequency. Used in spectroscopy to analyze light.",
                    "Atmospheric Refraction: Bending of light as it passes through atmosphere due to varying density. Effects: Twinkling of stars (light bends through layers of different density, appears to flicker), Advanced sunrise and delayed sunset (light bends, we see sun before it actually rises, after it sets), Stars appear higher than actual position. Refraction increases near horizon. Explains many optical phenomena in sky. Important in astronomy and navigation.",

Sky appears blue because blue light scatters more. Sun appears red at sunrise/sunset because blue light scattered away, red light reaches us. Tyndall effect: Scattering by colloidal particles makes path of light visible. Used in explaining colors of sky, sunset, and various optical phenomena.",

Critical angle is angle of incidence for which angle of refraction is 90°. Applications: Optical fibers (total internal reflection keeps light inside fiber), Prisms in periscopes, Diamonds (brilliance due to multiple total internal reflections). Important in fiber optic communication and various optical devices.",

Understanding prism refraction helps in understanding how lenses and optical instruments work.",

Rods detect light intensity (black and white vision). Color perception depends on wavelengths of light. Objects appear colored because they reflect that color, absorb others. Understanding color helps in: Art, Design, Technology, Medicine (diagnosis).",

Problems: Some conflicts (communal, caste-based), discrimination persists, inequalities remain. However, India remains united despite diversity. Factors: Democratic system, power sharing, constitutional protections, respect for diversity, dialogue and compromise. India's experience shows diversity can be managed in democracy, but requires constant effort."

Gender inequality: Women have less access to education, employment, property, political power. Patriarchal society: Male-dominated, women subordinate. Effects: Limits women's potential, wastes talent, violates human rights, hinders development. Need: Gender equality - equal rights, opportunities, and treatment.

Functions: Contest elections (put up candidates), Form government (if win majority), Make policies (decide what government does), Provide opposition (criticize government if not in power), Shape public opinion (influence people's views). Parties are essential link between people and government. Without parties, democracy cannot function effectively.",

Functions: Criticize government policies, Expose wrongdoings, Present alternatives, Ensure accountability, Represent people's voice, Participate in debates, Check abuse of power. Strong opposition is sign of healthy democracy. Opposition keeps government on toes, ensures transparency, provides alternative. Weak opposition weakens democracy.

Features: Government must explain its actions, Answer questions, Accept responsibility, Face elections regularly. People can: Question government, Protest against wrong policies, Change government through elections, Demand information (RTI), Hold government responsible. Legitimate Government: People accept government as rightful, even if they don't agree with all policies. Responsive: Government responds to people's needs and demands.

However, democracy provides: Better quality of life (health, education, social services), More equitable distribution, Less poverty, Better human development indicators. Reason: Democracy focuses on people's welfare, not just growth. Growth without development is meaningless. Democracy ensures growth benefits all, not just few. Long-term, democracy may have slower but more sustainable and equitable growth.",
                    "Reduction of Inequality: Democracy should reduce economic inequality, but this remains a challenge. Problem: Economic inequality persists and may even increase in democracies. Rich-poor gap is growing in many democracies including India. Reasons: Influence of money in politics, Policies favor rich, Poor have less voice, Globalization benefits some more. However, democracy provides: Tools to fight inequality (voting, protests, movements), Policies for poor (welfare schemes, reservations), Pressure on government to reduce inequality. Challenge: Make democracy more effective in reducing inequality. Need: Stronger policies, Better implementation, People's participation.",

Features: All groups can express themselves, Participate in politics, Get representation, Have their interests considered. Examples: India accommodates multiple religions, languages, castes, regions through democracy. Other systems (dictatorship, monarchy) often suppress diversity. Democracy allows: Different identities to coexist, Peaceful resolution of conflicts, Power sharing, Protection of minorities. This is major achievement of democracy. Diversity is strength in democracy, not weakness.",

Dignity: All individuals are equal, No one is superior or inferior, Everyone has right to be treated with respect, Marginalized groups get recognition. Freedom: Freedom of expression, Freedom to choose, Freedom to protest, Freedom to form associations, Freedom of religion. In democracy: Every citizen has equal rights, Can participate in governance, Can challenge authority, Can demand justice. This dignity and freedom is not available in other systems. Essential for human development.",
                    "Quality of Decision Making: Democratic decisions may be slower but are better quality. Process: Discussion and debate, Consideration of different views, Consultation with experts, Public scrutiny, Transparency. Result: More informed decisions, Consider various perspectives, More acceptable to people, More legitimate, Less likely to be wrong. Slower but better: Takes time but quality is higher. Dictatorships may decide faster but often make mistakes. Democratic decisions have wider support and are more sustainable. Quality over speed.",
                    "Corruption: Democracy has corruption, but provides mechanisms to check it. Problem: Corruption exists in all democracies, including India. Causes: Money in politics, Weak institutions, Lack of accountability, Culture of impunity. However, democracy provides: Transparency (RTI, media freedom), Accountability (elections, opposition), Institutions to check (courts, anti-corruption agencies), People's power (protests, movements). Mechanisms: Free press exposes corruption, Courts punish corrupt, Elections throw out corrupt governments, People's movements demand action. Democracy can fight corruption if institutions are strong.",

Feature: Regular elections ensure peaceful change of government, No violence or coup needed, Losers accept defeat, Winners don't abuse power excessively, System continues regardless of who wins. Examples: India has had peaceful transfers of power for 75+ years. Contrast: Dictatorships often have violent transitions, Coups, Civil wars. Stability in democracy: Comes from people's acceptance, Not from force. This stability is great achievement. However, some democracies face instability due to weak institutions.",

Forms: Voting in elections, Joining political parties, Forming pressure groups, Participating in movements, Protests and demonstrations, Contacting representatives, Using RTI, Public hearings, Gram Sabhas. Benefits: People feel part of system, Decisions have legitimacy, Government is responsive, People are empowered, Democracy is strengthened. More participation = stronger democracy. Low participation weakens democracy. Need: Encourage more people to participate, Remove barriers, Make participation meaningful.",
                    "Challenges and Improvements: Need to improve accountability (make government more answerable), Reduce inequality (policies for poor, better distribution), Check corruption (stronger laws, better enforcement), Ensure participation (remove barriers, encourage involvement), Strengthen institutions (courts, election commission, anti-corruption agencies), Reduce influence of money (reform funding, limit spending), Improve quality of politics (focus on issues, not identities). Democracy is not perfect but is best system. Constant improvement needed. People's participation is key to improving democracy. Future of democracy depends on addressing these challenges."

For urban unemployed: Job opportunities, better education, health facilities. For girl from rich family: Freedom to choose career, equal opportunities, safe environment. Development means different things to different people. Important to consider all perspectives, not just one view.",

Education: Knowledge, skills, opportunities, empowerment. Health: Long life, good health, access to healthcare. Freedom: Freedom to choose, express, participate, live with dignity. Security: Protection from violence, natural disasters, economic shocks. Respect: Treated with dignity, no discrimination, equal treatment. Equal Treatment: No discrimination based on caste, religion, gender. All goals are important, not just income. Development is multidimensional.",

People also want: Education (for themselves and children), Health (good healthcare, long life), Freedom (to choose, express, participate), Security (job security, social security), Respect (dignity, no discrimination), Equal treatment (justice, fairness). Example: Person may prefer job with less income but more freedom and respect. Development cannot be measured only by income. Human development includes all aspects of life. Quality of life matters more than just quantity of money.",

Includes: Economic development (GDP, per capita income, employment), Social development (education, health, gender equality), Human development (HDI, quality of life), Environmental sustainability (clean environment, resource conservation). National development should benefit all sections, not just some. Should be sustainable and inclusive. Different countries may prioritize differently based on their situation. Development is ongoing process, not destination.",

Social: Literacy rate, school enrollment, life expectancy, infant mortality rate, maternal mortality rate. Health: Life expectancy, infant mortality, access to healthcare, nutrition levels. Gender: Gender ratio, women's literacy, women's employment, women's participation. Environmental: Air quality, water quality, forest cover, carbon emissions. No single indicator is sufficient. Need multiple indicators for complete picture. Different indicators may show different results. Important to consider all aspects.",

Range: 0 to 1 (higher is better). HDI is better indicator than income alone because: Considers multiple aspects, Focuses on people, Not just economic growth, Comparable across countries. India's HDI: Around 0.65 (medium human development). Higher HDI = better quality of life. HDI helps compare countries and track progress. However, HDI also has limitations - doesn't capture all aspects.",

Principles: Use resources wisely, Don't exhaust non-renewable resources, Protect environment, Maintain ecological balance, Consider long-term impact. Features: Economic growth with environmental protection, Social equity, Inter-generational equity (fairness between generations). Examples: Renewable energy, Organic farming, Waste reduction, Afforestation. Sustainable development is essential because: Resources are limited, Environment is fragile, Future generations have rights. Development must be sustainable to be meaningful.",
                    "Public Facilities: Essential services provided by government for all citizens. Examples: Education (schools, colleges, scholarships), Health (hospitals, clinics, immunization), Water (safe drinking water supply), Sanitation (toilets, sewage systems), Electricity (power supply), Roads (connectivity), Public transport (affordable mobility). Importance: Essential for development, Cannot be left to market alone, Ensure access for all, Reduce inequality, Improve quality of life. Government must provide these because: Private sector may not provide to all, May be too expensive, Essential for basic needs. Public facilities are foundation of development.",

Problem: Often development (industrialization, urbanization) causes environmental damage (pollution, deforestation, climate change). Need: Sustainable development that protects environment. Balance: Economic growth with environmental protection. Methods: Clean technologies, Renewable energy, Waste management, Afforestation, Conservation, Environmental regulations. Examples: Solar energy instead of coal, Electric vehicles, Waste recycling, Forest conservation. Environment and development are not opposed - can go together. Sustainable development is only way forward. Future depends on this balance.",
                    "Challenges: Poverty: Large number of people below poverty line, need income generation, employment, social security. Inequality: Huge gap between rich and poor, need redistribution, inclusive policies. Unemployment: Lack of jobs, need skill development, job creation, economic growth. Environmental Degradation: Pollution, deforestation, climate change, need sustainable practices. Solutions: Inclusive development (benefits all), Sustainable development (protects environment), Education and skills (empowerment), Infrastructure (enables development), Good governance (effective policies), People's participation (democratic development).
